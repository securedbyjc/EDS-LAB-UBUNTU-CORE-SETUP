### ✅ Next Step Suggestions

1. **Add inline comments** in both scripts — especially for learning repo audiences.
2. **Push to GitHub** and write a short description on your repo's landing page.
3. Later: Tag `v1.0.0` when you're done with Parrot & Kali builds.

Want help drafting the inline comments or converting this into a `Makefile` or Ansible role later? We can absolutely do that. This repo already looks clean enough for a blog post series 📘⚙️
